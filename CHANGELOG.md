# Changelog

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed template engine file pattern detection bug

- # Factory Pattern Example Summary

  ## Problem Solved

  This example addresses a critical bug in the ollypop template engine where factory export patterns failed with the error:

  ```
  Cannot determine path from export template. Expected format: export * from "./path/{variable}/..."
  ```

  ## Root Cause

  The template engine's regex pattern `/^export \* from ['"](.+?)\{/` only supported basic export syntax:

  ```typescript
  export * from './path/{variable}';
  ```

  But failed to recognize factory patterns with aliases:

  ```typescript
  export * as Name{variable}Factory from './path/{variable}'
  ```

  ## Solution

  Updated the regex pattern in `src/templates.ts` to be more flexible:

  ```typescript
  // Before (restrictive)
  const exportPathMatch = exportTemplate.match(/^export \* from ['"](.+?)\{/);

  // After (flexible - supports both patterns)
  const exportPathMatch = exportTemplate.match(/from ['"]([^'"]*)\{/);
  ```

  This change:
  - ✅ Supports `export * from './path/{variable}'` (original)
  - ✅ Supports `export * as Name from './path/{variable}'` (factory pattern)
  - ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with all existing examples
  - ✅ Enables complex export alias patterns

  ## Configuration

  ```json
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "barrels": [
      {
        "name": "cutie-factories",
        "output": "./src/cutie/index.ts",
        "template": {
          "name": "variable-template",
          "export": "export * as Cutie{fileName:pascal}Factory from './{fileName:raw}.ts'"
        },
        "options": {
          "preserveExtensions": true,
          "extensions": [".ts"],
          "validateExports": false,
          "dryRun": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Generated Output

  ```typescript
  // This file is auto-generated by @validkeys/ollypop-ts
  // Do not edit this file manually - your changes will be overwritten

  export * as CutieChangesetFactory from './changeset.ts';
  export * as CutieInstructionFactory from './instruction.ts';
  ```

  ## Key Learnings
  1. **Template Flexibility**: Variable templates need to support diverse export patterns beyond basic re-exports
  2. **Regex Design**: Use minimal, focused patterns that capture the essential structure rather than the entire syntax
  3. **Backward Compatibility**: Always test existing examples when making template engine changes
  4. **Error Messages**: Provide clear guidance on supported patterns in error messages

  ## Testing

  All existing examples continue to work:
  - ✅ basic-barrel (file-based exports)
  - ✅ directory-barrel (directory-based exports)
  - ✅ with-extensions (file exports with .js extension)
  - ✅ directory-with-extensions (directory exports with service.js files)
  - ✅ factory-pattern (new - alias exports with transformations)

  This fix enables ollypop to support a much wider range of TypeScript export patterns while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed template engine file pattern detection for `{file}` variables without explicit extensions
- Fixed working directory resolution when export path is current directory (`.`)
- Template engine now correctly identifies file-based patterns using `{file:raw}` syntax
- Examples now generate proper barrel exports for both file-based and directory-based patterns

### Added

- Comprehensive example projects demonstrating various barrel generation patterns:
  - `basic-barrel`: File-based exports without extensions
  - `directory-barrel`: Directory-based exports without extensions
  - `with-extensions`: File-based exports with `.js` extensions for compiled output
  - `directory-with-extensions`: Directory-based exports with `.js` extensions for compiled output
- npm scripts to run all examples: `pnpm run examples`
- Individual example scripts: `example:basic`, `example:directory`, `example:with-extensions`, `example:directory-extensions`

### Changed

- Updated package name from "Internal Barrel Maker" to "Ollypop"
- CLI command renamed from `barrel-maker` to `ollypop`
- Package configured for npm publication as `@validkeys/ollypop-ts`
- TypeScript builds now output to `dist/` directory for npm distribution

### Technical

- Added Changesets for automated version management and changelog generation
- Configured prepublish hooks with linting and testing
- Added Prettier for code formatting
- Set up build pipeline for TypeScript compilation
- Created `.npmignore` to exclude development files from npm package
